# Contributing to MLX Swift Examples

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork and submit pull requests to the repo. 
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Every PR should have passing tests (if any) and at least one review. 
4. For code formatting install `pre-commit` using something like `pip install pre-commit` and run `pre-commit install`.
   If needed you may need to `brew install swift-format`.
 
   You can also run the formatters manually as follows:
 
     ```
     swift-format format --in-place --recursive Libraries Tools Applications
     ```
 
   or run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check all files in the repo.
