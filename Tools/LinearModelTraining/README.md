#  LinearModelTraining

A command line tool that creates a Model that represents:

    f(x) = mx + b
    
and trains it against an unknown linear function. Very
simple but illustrates:

- a very simple model with parameters
- a loss function
- the gradient
- use of an optimizers
- the training loop
